### Why is using DOIs important for researchers?
---
DOIs are unique identifiers that provide a permanent link to digital resources such as datasets, software, or publications. Using DOIs makes it easier for other researchers to find and cite your work, and it ensures that your work is properly credited and attributed. DOIs also make it easier to track the usage and impact of your research outputs, which can be important for career advancement, funding opportunities, and other purposes.

In summary, using Zenodo and DOIs is a useful and important tool for researchers to ensure proper credit and attribution for their digital resources, and to enable easier discovery and citation of their work by others. The ability to connect Zenodo to GitHub provides an added convenience for researchers who want to streamline their workflows and automate the process of uploading and assigning DOIs to their digital resources.
