### Merging

Merging is the process of combining two or more branches into a single branch. It is often used in collaborative development when multiple developers are working on the same project and need to merge their changes into a single branch. The process involves checking out the branch you want to merge into, and then using the Git merge command to merge the changes from the other branch.

Step-by-Step Guide:

Open the Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the Git plugin.
Click on the "Branches" tab to view the list of branches in the repository.
Select the branch you want to merge into (i.e., the target branch) by clicking on it.
Click on the "Merge" button in the toolbar at the top of the Git plugin window.
In the "Merge Branch" dialog box, select the branch you want to merge from (i.e., the source branch).
Choose the merge strategy you want to use. The default is "Fast-forward merge," but you can also choose "Merge commit" or "Squash merge."
Click the "Merge" button to complete the merge.
If there are any conflicts between the two branches, the Git plugin will display a message indicating the files with conflicts. Resolve the conflicts manually, then save the files and commit the changes.
After the merge is complete, you can delete the source branch if you no longer need it.
