## Branches and Tags

Branches and tags are important tools in Git that allow you to manage and organize your code base. Branches are used to create a separate copy of your code base so that you can work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main code base. Tags are used to mark specific points in your Git history, such as major releases or milestones.

Branches:

Open the Jupyter Notebook Git plugin.
Click on the "Branches" tab.
Click the "New Branch" button.
Enter a name for the new branch and click "Create Branch".
The plugin will switch to the new branch and you can begin making changes to your code base.


Tags:

Open the Jupyter Notebook Git plugin.
Click on the "Tags" tab.
Click the "New Tag" button.
Enter a name for the new tag and select the commit you want to tag.
Click "Create Tag" to create the tag.
You can now use this tag to easily reference this specific commit in the future.
