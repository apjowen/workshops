## Introduction to Version Control

### What is version control?

Version control is an essential tool for anyone who works with code, and that includes academics who are new to programming. Version control is a system that allows you to keep track of changes to your code over time, and it is especially important when collaborating with others on a project.

Here are some of the benefits of using version control with Git:

- **Collaboration**: Git allows multiple people to work on the same codebase at the same time. It keeps track of who made what changes and when, and it helps to avoid conflicts that can arise when two people make changes to the same file at the same time.

- **History**: Git keeps a complete history of all changes made to your codebase. This means that you can easily see what changes were made, when they were made, and who made them. You can also revert to an earlier version of your code if you make a mistake or want to undo a change.

- **Branching and merging**: Git makes it easy to create new branches of your codebase, which allows you to work on new features or experiments without affecting the main codebase. You can then merge your changes back into the main codebase when they are ready.

- **Backup**: Git provides a reliable and easy-to-use backup system for your codebase. By storing your code in a Git repository, you can ensure that it is backed up regularly and that you can easily restore it if something goes wrong.

Academics who are new to programming should invest time in learning Git because it is an essential tool for anyone working with code. It will help you to collaborate more effectively with others, keep a complete history of changes to your codebase, work on new features without affecting the main codebase, and provide a reliable backup system for your code. With Git, you can focus on your research and experiments, confident that your code is well-organised, well-documented, and easy to manage.
