## Introduction to Version Control

Version control is a system that allows you to keep track of changes to your code over time, and it is especially important when collaborating with others on a project. It is an essential tool for anyone who works with code, including academics who are new to programming.

With version control, you can collaborate more effectively with others, keep a complete history of changes to your codebase, work on new features without affecting the main codebase, and provide a reliable backup system for your code. It allows you to focus on your research and experiments, confident that your code is well-organized, well-documented, and easy to manage.

Git is a popular version control system that provides many benefits, including:

  - **Collaboration**: Git allows multiple people to work on the same codebase at the same time. It keeps track of who made what changes and when, and it helps to avoid conflicts that can arise when two people make changes to the same file at the same time.

  - **History**: Git keeps a complete history of all changes made to your codebase. This means that you can easily see what changes were made, when they were made, and who made them. You can also revert to an earlier version of your code if you make a mistake or want to undo a change.

  - **Branching**: and merging: Git makes it easy to create new branches of your codebase, which allows you to work on new features or experiments without affecting the main codebase. You can then merge your changes back into the main codebase when they are ready.

  - **Backup**: Git provides a reliable and easy-to-use backup system for your codebase. By storing your code in a Git repository, you can ensure that it is backed up regularly and that you can easily restore it if something goes wrong.
As an academic who is new to programming, investing time in learning Git will help you to work more efficiently and effectively, whether you are collaborating with others or working on your own. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you will be able to set up and use Git with confidence, and you will be able to apply these skills to your research projects.
