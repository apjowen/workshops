## Collaborating

Version control is useful because it allows you to keep track of changes to your code over time. This is particularly important when collaborating with others, as it enables multiple people to work on the same codebase without overwriting each other's changes.

One popular version control system is Git, which is designed to be lightweight and easy to use. Git allows you to create a local repository on your computer, where you can track changes to your code, and then push those changes to a remote repository, such as GitHub, where you can collaborate with others.

Connecting your local repository to GitHub involves a few steps. First, you need to create a GitHub account and a new repository. Then, you need to add your remote repository URL to your local Git repository, which allows you to push changes to GitHub. Finally, you can push your changes to GitHub, where they will be visible to others who have access to the repository.

By connecting your local repository to GitHub, you make it easy to collaborate with others, as you can easily share your code changes and keep everyone up to date with the latest version of the code.


### Create a Github account

2. Click the "Sign up" button in the top right corner of the page.

3. Enter your desired username, email address, and password.

4. Click the "Create account" button.

5. GitHub will then ask you to choose a plan. Select the "Free" plan.

9. Choose the "Public" option.

10. You can choose to initialize the repository with a README file, which can provide a brief introduction to your project. This step is optional.

11. Click the "Create repository" button.
