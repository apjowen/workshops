## Conflicts

Resolving conflicts in Git involves identifying and addressing conflicting changes made by different contributors to the same file or files. Git provides tools to help resolve these conflicts and merge the changes together. The Jupyter Notebook Git plugin also has features to help resolve conflicts.

# steps
Before making any changes, ensure that your local repository is up-to-date with the remote repository by running the command git pull in the Git Bash or terminal.
Make changes to the file(s) and commit them to your local repository.
Before pushing your changes to the remote repository, run the command git pull in the Git Bash or terminal again to ensure that your local repository is still up-to-date with the remote repository. If there are any changes from the remote repository, Git will try to automatically merge them with your local changes.
If there are conflicts during the merge process, you will be notified by Git. Open the file(s) in question and look for the conflict markers, which typically look like <<<<<<< HEAD, =======, and >>>>>>>. The lines between <<<<<<< HEAD and ======= represent the changes made in your local repository, while the lines between ======= and >>>>>>> represent the changes made in the remote repository.
Edit the file(s) to resolve the conflicts by removing the conflict markers and deciding which changes to keep. Save the file(s) once you have made your changes.
In the Git plugin, click on the "Changes" tab and you should see the conflicted file(s) listed under the "Unmerged" section.
Right-click on the conflicted file(s) and select "Merge Tool" to open the built-in merge tool in Jupyter Notebook.
The merge tool will show the conflicting sections side-by-side, with your local changes on the left and the remote changes on the right. Use the tool to decide which changes to keep, and click the "Save" button once you have made your selections.
Once you have resolved all conflicts, commit the changes to your local repository and push them to the remote repository.
